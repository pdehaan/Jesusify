Jesusify is a module that takes the path to an image and outputs that same image with a picture of Jesus Christ 
and the words "Jesus loves you" overtop of it. It also allows one to pass a callback function that takes two
parameters: an error (null if no errors occurred) and a JIMP image object (null if an error occurred). 
Here is an example of its use:

var jesusify = require('jesusify');

//Jesusifies the file at "./picture.jpeg" and writes it to "./jesusified_picture.jpeg".
//Then, writes the jesusified image to "./profile_picture.png" if there was no error.
jesusify.jesusify("./picture.jpeg", "./jesusified_picture.jpeg", function (err, image) {
	if (err) {
		console.error("Received error: \"" + err + "\"");
		return;
	}

	image.write("profile_picture.png");
});
